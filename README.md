Kumusta!

I'm currently in my last year of studies at University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business and will graduate with a BBA in Information Systems. I work full-time in human resources and attend school on a part-time basis. I enjoy learning new skills and gaining knowledge of new technologies and modern techniques. I look forward to exploring this coding World!
